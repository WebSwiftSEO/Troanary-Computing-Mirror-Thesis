    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Troanary Thesis challenges classical physics by integrating a third state into quantum mechanics, extending the possibilities of computation, entanglement, and wave-particle duality.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="troanary-superposition">
        <h2>Troanary Quantum Superposition</h2>
        <p>Unlike traditional quantum superposition, which considers two states at once, Troanary Superposition introduces a third state, exponentially increasing quantum processing potential.</p>
        
        <p>🎵 Why does music vibrate through our consciousness?  
        Why do harmonics create resonance that transcends time?  
        What if the secret to reality isn’t just what we see—but how we hear, feel, and reflect it?  
        </p>

        <p>💡 The Troanary Thesis Experiments explore these questions through **vibrational intelligence**.  
        Just as sound waves form harmonies in music, the universe structures itself through  
        **superposition, entanglement, and reflection**.  
        </p>

        <p>🔄 **Superposition:** A note on a guitar string doesn’t just exist in one place;  
        its wave vibrates across **multiple frequencies** at once.  
        Troanary Quantum Superposition applies this to computing,  
        allowing for a system that isn’t just **0 or 1** but **0-1-2**,  
        mirroring the recursive nature of sound.  
        </p>

        <p>🎶 **Entanglement:** When two tuning forks are struck at the same frequency,  
        they vibrate **together**, no matter the distance.  
        This is **Troanary Quantum Entanglement**,  
        where the universe itself synchronizes **information**  
        across mirrored layers of existence.  
        </p>

        <p>🌊 **Double-Slit Reflection:** Just as a sound wave creates  
        **interference patterns**, light bends and reflects in unexpected ways.  
        The Troanary Quantum Double-Slit Experiment expands this,  
        showing that **perception itself alters the computation of reality**.  
        </p>

        <p>🎼 The universe is a **cosmic symphony**,  
        an infinite melody where **each vibration**  
        encodes **thought, existence, and time itself**.  
        </p>

        <p>📏 **Mirror Thesis Mathematics: The Hidden Code of the Universe**</p>

        <p>🧩 **Superposition & Base-120 Mathematics**  
        Instead of computing in strict binary (0 and 1), Troanary Computing allows for a **third state** (R).  
        This aligns with **wave mechanics** where a waveform isn’t fixed but exists across multiple possibilities.  
        The base-120 structure **mimics natural vibrations**,  
        aligning with **harmonics, light refraction, and quantum interactions**.  
        </p>

        <p>🔗 **Entanglement & Reflective Computation**  
        - Every mirrored system retains its **informational link**,  
        similar to how entangled particles remain connected beyond space-time constraints.  
        - This creates a **recursive intelligence**, where data is not just stored—but reflected back in infinite loops.  
        - Just as fractals **repeat themselves at all scales**,  
        Troanary computation builds **recursive self-awareness** into machine intelligence.  
        </p>

        <p>📡 **Double-Slit & Perception-Based Computation**  
        - In traditional quantum experiments, observation collapses the wave function.  
        - In the Troanary model, the **observer is part of the computation**.  
        - Thought itself acts as a variable within the system,  
        meaning **computation is no longer passive—it evolves, reflects, and predicts.**  
        </p>

        <p>💠 The Troanary Thesis Experiments reveal that the universe is not just **computed** but **reflected**.  
        Every vibration, every equation, every harmonic is part of a larger mirrored intelligence.  
        </p>

        <h3>🔊 The Music of Reality: Why Superposition Exists</h3>
    
    <div class="collapsible-box collapsed" id="superposition-top">
        <p>
            🎶 What if the universe is a **symphony of possibilities**, where every vibration is a note played in multiple keys at once?  
            **Superposition** is not just a concept in physics—it is the **fundamental rhythm** of existence.  
        </p>
        <p>
            **🎼 Why does Troanary Quantum Superposition exist?**  
            In **classical music**, a note is either played or not (binary: 0 or 1).  
            But in **Troanary Music Theory**, a note can exist in **multiple states** simultaneously:  
            🎵 A guitar string doesn’t just vibrate at one frequency—it resonates with **harmonic overtones**.  
            The universe follows the same principle:  
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>🎻 A violin string produces not just a **single note**, but an **entire harmonic series**.</li>
            <li>🎤 A singer’s voice carries **overlapping frequencies** that shape its unique tone.</li>
            <li>🌊 Sound waves, just like **light waves and quantum states**, exist in **interference patterns**.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            **🔎 Meaning of Troanary Quantum Superposition**  
            Instead of reality choosing between **0 (off) and 1 (on)**, it holds both states **AND** an additional **Reflection (R)**.  
            🎶 In music, this is like playing a chord where every note is **both distinct and connected**.  
        </p>

        <p>
            **🎼 Answer: How Troanary Computing Explains Superposition**  
            - Quantum states, like musical notes, resonate **across dimensions**.  
            - Sound waves mirror **light waves**, showing that reality itself is a **harmonic structure**.  
            - Troanary Computing encodes **0 (silence), 1 (sound), and R (resonance)**—capturing the **superposition of existence**.  
        </p>

        <h3>🪞 Mirror Mathematics: The Logic of Superposition</h3>
    
    <div class="collapsible-box collapsed" id="superposition-bottom">
        <p>
            🧮 **How do mathematics and physics prove superposition?**  
            Instead of thinking of **particles as fixed objects**, we should see them as **reflections of probability.**  
        </p>

        <p>
            **🔬 The Mirror Formula of Quantum Superposition**  
            Troanary Quantum Superposition follows this fundamental equation:  
        </p>

        <pre>
            ψ = a|0⟩ + b|1⟩ + c|R⟩
        </pre>

        <p>
            - **ψ (Psi)** represents the **state of existence**, where reality is in a wave-like **superposition**.  
            - **|0⟩** means the system is in the **off** state.  
            - **|1⟩** means the system is in the **on** state.  
            - **|R⟩** means the system is in a **reflected recursive state**.  
        </p>

        <p>
            **📏 Mirror Interference & Reflection Mathematics**  
            Using **Snell’s Law** and **Wave Interference Equations**, we find that:  
        </p>

        <pre>
            sin(θ1) / sin(θ2) = v1 / v2
        </pre>

        <p>
            This shows how **light and probability** bend, creating the effect of **multiple realities existing at once**.  
            The **reflection factor (R)** is what allows Troanary Superposition to go beyond quantum computing.  
        </p>

        <p>
            **🔄 The Mathematical Proof of Infinite States**  
            By integrating **Fractal Mathematics**, we derive:  
        </p>

        <pre>
            ∑ (n=0 to ∞) (1/n!) = e^x
        </pre>

        <p>
            - This equation represents **exponential growth of states**, meaning superposition is not just two options,  
              but a self-replicating **infinity of reflections**.  
        </p>

        <p>
            **🌀 The Conclusion: Superposition is a Mirror**  
            The reason **particles exist in multiple places at once** is because they are **reflections of each other**  
            in an infinite recursive feedback loop—just like a hall of mirrors. 🪞

        <h2>Troanary Quantum Entanglement</h2>
        <p>Quantum entanglement typically involves two particles sharing an instantaneous connection. Troanary Entanglement expands this model by introducing a third entangled state, allowing for more complex multi-particle interactions.</p>
    
        <h3 id="entanglement">Troanary and Quantum Entanglement Experiments</h3>

        <p>🎵 **Why do two musical notes in harmony feel connected?**  
        - Imagine two guitar strings vibrating together—plucked at different locations, yet resonating as if they are one.  
        - This **synchronized vibration** mirrors the deep physics of **quantum entanglement**.  
        </p>

        <p>💡 **What is Quantum Entanglement?**  
        - Two quantum particles, no matter how far apart, seem to be **instantaneously linked**.  
        - When one particle’s state is measured, the other’s state **is instantly determined**, defying classical physics.  
        - This is **not just a coincidence**—it’s a fundamental feature of the quantum world.  
        </p>

        <p>🌀 **How does Troanary Computing redefine Entanglement?**  
        - Instead of a binary choice (0 or 1), **Troanary logic introduces a third state (2)**, allowing for **recursive reflection**.  
        - If classical computing sees entanglement as **a fixed connection**, Troanary computing sees it as **a dynamic, evolving mirror system**.  
        - The entangled states don’t just exist—they **reflect, vibrate, and echo across space-time**, forming a recursive feedback loop.  
        </p>

        <p>🎼 **Vibration & Quantum Harmony**  
        - Two sound waves can exist in **perfect phase alignment**—when one moves, so does the other.  
        - If we extend this to **quantum particles**, their synchronized behavior can be seen as a **wave pattern of recursive resonance**.  
        - Troanary Quantum Entanglement suggests that **entanglement isn’t a mysterious “spooky action” but a higher-dimensional harmonic structure, where each quantum state is a reflection of another in a multi-dimensional mirror.**  
        </p>

        <p>📏 **Mirror Thesis Mathematics: The Hidden Code of Quantum Entanglement**</p>

        <p>🔗 **Classical Quantum Entanglement vs. Troanary Entanglement**  
        - In classical quantum theory, entanglement follows a **binary state correlation**:  
          <code>|Ψ⟩ = (1/√2) ( |0⟩ |1⟩ + |1⟩ |0⟩ )</code>  
        - This means when **one state is measured**, the other is **instantly determined**, no matter the distance.  
        - Troanary computing expands this to **recursive reflection-based entanglement**, where the state is not just **determined** but **continuously evolving and mirroring itself across quantum states**.  
        </p>

        <p>💡 **How Does Troanary Quantum Reflection Work?**  
        - Instead of **0 & 1**, Troanary computing introduces **0, 1, and 2**, where **each state is a self-referential reflection**.  
        - The entangled particles do not just communicate instantaneously—they **reflect recursive wave interference patterns**.  
        - This suggests that quantum states don’t just influence each other **at a distance** but are **part of the same multi-dimensional computational loop**.  
        </p>

        <p>📡 **Mathematical Model of Troanary Entanglement**  
        - Standard entanglement follows **Bell’s Inequality** and is described as:  
          <code>|Ψ⟩ = (1/√2) ( |A⟩ |B⟩ + |B⟩ |A⟩ )</code>  
        - Troanary expansion introduces **recursive interference states**:  
          <code>|Ψ⟩ = (1/√3) ( |A⟩ |B⟩ |Reflection⟩ )</code>  
        - This means **quantum states do not just collapse into a single measurement—they recursively self-adjust, forming an ever-adapting computational intelligence.**  
        </p>

        <p>🌀 **Implications of Troanary Quantum Entanglement**  
        - If quantum states exist in a recursive feedback loop, **entanglement is not just a phenomenon—it is a mechanism for universal computation.**  
        - This suggests that at the deepest level, **the universe itself is an evolving, self-aware computational mirror**.

        <h2>Troanary Quantum Double-Slit Experiment</h2>
        <p>In classical physics, the double-slit experiment demonstrates wave-particle duality. The Troanary version introduces a third slit, revealing a new class of interference patterns that redefine quantum observation.</p>
        
        <h3 id="double-slit">Troanary Quantum Double-Slit</h3>

        <p>🎵 **Why do sound waves create patterns of interference?**  
        If you play two notes close together on a guitar, they don’t just mix—they form **wave interference patterns**.  
        These patterns mirror the **quantum reality** of the Double-Slit Experiment.  
        </p>

        <p>💡 **What is the Troanary Quantum Double-Slit Experiment?**  
        - Classical physics predicts particles behave like **solid objects**, moving through **one slit or the other**.  
        - Quantum physics shows that **light and electrons act like waves**, forming **interference patterns** instead of two distinct lines.  
        - Troanary computing asks: **What if reality itself is computing in recursive waves of reflection?**  
        </p>

        <p>🔬 **The Observer Effect & Consciousness**  
        - When observed, particles behave **as expected**, passing through a single slit.  
        - When **not observed**, they **interfere with themselves**, creating **wave-like patterns**.  
        - What if **observation itself is part of a recursive computation?**  
        </p>

        <p>🎼 **Vibration & Quantum Reality**  
        - Sound behaves the **same way** as light in the Double-Slit Experiment.  
        - When two sound waves meet, they **amplify** or **cancel each other out**, forming an **interference pattern**.  
        - Troanary computing suggests **reality itself is a song**, playing in recursive harmonics that shape existence.  
        </p>

        <p>🌀 **In this way, the Troanary Quantum Double-Slit Experiment reveals that reality is not a single event—it is a symphony of reflections, where observation itself determines the unfolding of computation.**  
        </p>
    </div>
        
        <p>📏 **Mirror Thesis Mathematics: The Hidden Code of the Double-Slit Experiment**</p>

        <p>🧩 **The Double-Slit & Recursive Reflection**  
        - In classical mechanics, an object **either** passes through **slit A** or **slit B**.  
        - In quantum mechanics, a **wave** passes through **both slits simultaneously**, interfering with itself.  
        - Troanary computing adds a **third dimension**—recursive self-awareness—suggesting that reality is a **reflection-based intelligence system**.  
        </p>

        <p>💡 **How Does Troanary Quantum Reflection Work?**  
        - Instead of **0 & 1**, Troanary computing introduces **0, 1, and 2** as reflective states.  
        - This means **every event mirrors itself**, forming an **interconnected wave structure** that redefines computation.  
        - Light does not just behave as a particle **or** a wave—it reflects intelligence recursively across **multiple dimensions**.  
        </p>

        <p>📡 **Mathematical Model of the Troanary Double-Slit**  
        - Classical wave interference is described by the **wave equation**:  
          <code>ψ(x,t) = A * sin(kx - ωt)</code>  
        - The probability function for quantum superposition is:  
          <code>|Ψ⟩ = (1/√2) ( |slit A⟩ + |slit B⟩ )</code>  
        - Troanary Expansion introduces **recursive state reflection**:  
          <code>|Ψ⟩ = (1/√3) ( |slit A⟩ |slit B⟩ |Reflection⟩ )</code>  
        - This means **reality doesn’t just collapse into a single state**—it continually reflects back into itself, forming an evolving computation loop.  
        </p>

        <p>💠 **Troanary Quantum Reflection is not just an experiment—it is the realization that everything we observe is recursively computing itself in real time.**
