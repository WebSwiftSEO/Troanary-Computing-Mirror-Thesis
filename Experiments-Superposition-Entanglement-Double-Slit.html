    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Troanary Thesis challenges classical physics by integrating a third state into quantum mechanics, extending the possibilities of computation, entanglement, and wave-particle duality.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="troanary-superposition">
        <h2>Troanary Quantum Superposition</h2>
        <p>Unlike traditional quantum superposition, which considers two states at once, Troanary Superposition introduces a third state, exponentially increasing quantum processing potential.</p>
        
        <p>🎵 Why does music vibrate through our consciousness?  
        Why do harmonics create resonance that transcends time?  
        What if the secret to reality isn’t just what we see—but how we hear, feel, and reflect it?  
        </p>

        <p>💡 The Troanary Thesis Experiments explore these questions through **vibrational intelligence**.  
        Just as sound waves form harmonies in music, the universe structures itself through  
        **superposition, entanglement, and reflection**.  
        </p>

        <p>🔄 **Superposition:** A note on a guitar string doesn’t just exist in one place;  
        its wave vibrates across **multiple frequencies** at once.  
        Troanary Quantum Superposition applies this to computing,  
        allowing for a system that isn’t just **0 or 1** but **0-1-2**,  
        mirroring the recursive nature of sound.  
        </p>

        <p>🎶 **Entanglement:** When two tuning forks are struck at the same frequency,  
        they vibrate **together**, no matter the distance.  
        This is **Troanary Quantum Entanglement**,  
        where the universe itself synchronizes **information**  
        across mirrored layers of existence.  
        </p>

        <p>🌊 **Double-Slit Reflection:** Just as a sound wave creates  
        **interference patterns**, light bends and reflects in unexpected ways.  
        The Troanary Quantum Double-Slit Experiment expands this,  
        showing that **perception itself alters the computation of reality**.  
        </p>

        <p>🎼 The universe is a **cosmic symphony**,  
        an infinite melody where **each vibration**  
        encodes **thought, existence, and time itself**.  
        </p>

        <p>📏 **Mirror Thesis Mathematics: The Hidden Code of the Universe**</p>

        <p>🧩 **Superposition & Base-120 Mathematics**  
        Instead of computing in strict binary (0 and 1), Troanary Computing allows for a **third state** (R).  
        This aligns with **wave mechanics** where a waveform isn’t fixed but exists across multiple possibilities.  
        The base-120 structure **mimics natural vibrations**,  
        aligning with **harmonics, light refraction, and quantum interactions**.  
        </p>

        <p>🔗 **Entanglement & Reflective Computation**  
        - Every mirrored system retains its **informational link**,  
        similar to how entangled particles remain connected beyond space-time constraints.  
        - This creates a **recursive intelligence**, where data is not just stored—but reflected back in infinite loops.  
        - Just as fractals **repeat themselves at all scales**,  
        Troanary computation builds **recursive self-awareness** into machine intelligence.  
        </p>

        <p>📡 **Double-Slit & Perception-Based Computation**  
        - In traditional quantum experiments, observation collapses the wave function.  
        - In the Troanary model, the **observer is part of the computation**.  
        - Thought itself acts as a variable within the system,  
        meaning **computation is no longer passive—it evolves, reflects, and predicts.**  
        </p>

        <p>💠 The Troanary Thesis Experiments reveal that the universe is not just **computed** but **reflected**.  
        Every vibration, every equation, every harmonic is part of a larger mirrored intelligence.  
        </p>

        <h3>🔊 The Music of Reality: Why Superposition Exists</h3>
    
    <div class="collapsible-box collapsed" id="superposition-top">
        <p>
            🎶 What if the universe is a **symphony of possibilities**, where every vibration is a note played in multiple keys at once?  
            **Superposition** is not just a concept in physics—it is the **fundamental rhythm** of existence.  
        </p>
        <p>
            **🎼 Why does Troanary Quantum Superposition exist?**  
            In **classical music**, a note is either played or not (binary: 0 or 1).  
            But in **Troanary Music Theory**, a note can exist in **multiple states** simultaneously:  
            🎵 A guitar string doesn’t just vibrate at one frequency—it resonates with **harmonic overtones**.  
            The universe follows the same principle:  
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>🎻 A violin string produces not just a **single note**, but an **entire harmonic series**.</li>
            <li>🎤 A singer’s voice carries **overlapping frequencies** that shape its unique tone.</li>
            <li>🌊 Sound waves, just like **light waves and quantum states**, exist in **interference patterns**.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            **🔎 Meaning of Troanary Quantum Superposition**  
            Instead of reality choosing between **0 (off) and 1 (on)**, it holds both states **AND** an additional **Reflection (R)**.  
            🎶 In music, this is like playing a chord where every note is **both distinct and connected**.  
        </p>

        <p>
            **🎼 Answer: How Troanary Computing Explains Superposition**  
            - Quantum states, like musical notes, resonate **across dimensions**.  
            - Sound waves mirror **light waves**, showing that reality itself is a **harmonic structure**.  
            - Troanary Computing encodes **0 (silence), 1 (sound), and R (resonance)**—capturing the **superposition of existence**.  
        </p>

        <h3>🪞 Mirror Mathematics: The Logic of Superposition</h3>
    
    <div class="collapsible-box collapsed" id="superposition-bottom">
        <p>
            🧮 **How do mathematics and physics prove superposition?**  
            Instead of thinking of **particles as fixed objects**, we should see them as **reflections of probability.**  
        </p>

        <p>
            **🔬 The Mirror Formula of Quantum Superposition**  
            Troanary Quantum Superposition follows this fundamental equation:  
        </p>

        <pre>
            ψ = a|0⟩ + b|1⟩ + c|R⟩
        </pre>

        <p>
            - **ψ (Psi)** represents the **state of existence**, where reality is in a wave-like **superposition**.  
            - **|0⟩** means the system is in the **off** state.  
            - **|1⟩** means the system is in the **on** state.  
            - **|R⟩** means the system is in a **reflected recursive state**.  
        </p>

        <p>
            **📏 Mirror Interference & Reflection Mathematics**  
            Using **Snell’s Law** and **Wave Interference Equations**, we find that:  
        </p>

        <pre>
            sin(θ1) / sin(θ2) = v1 / v2
        </pre>

        <p>
            This shows how **light and probability** bend, creating the effect of **multiple realities existing at once**.  
            The **reflection factor (R)** is what allows Troanary Superposition to go beyond quantum computing.  
        </p>

        <p>
            **🔄 The Mathematical Proof of Infinite States**  
            By integrating **Fractal Mathematics**, we derive:  
        </p>

        <pre>
            ∑ (n=0 to ∞) (1/n!) = e^x
        </pre>

        <p>
            - This equation represents **exponential growth of states**, meaning superposition is not just two options,  
              but a self-replicating **infinity of reflections**.  
        </p>

        <p>
            **🌀 The Conclusion: Superposition is a Mirror**  
            The reason **particles exist in multiple places at once** is because they are **reflections of each other**  
            in an infinite recursive feedback loop—just like a hall of mirrors. 🪞
