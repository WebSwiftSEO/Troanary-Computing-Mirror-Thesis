Troanary Computing: The Next Step Beyond Binary Logic

Troanary Computing introduces a new computational framework that expands beyond binary logic (0s and 1s) by incorporating a third state (*). This adaptive, reflective system mirrors the complexity of nature and intelligence itself.

Key Concepts:
	•	Binary Logic: Traditional systems use 0 (absence) and 1 (presence).
	•	Troanary Logic: Introduces a third state (*), representing reflection, adaptation, and emergent intelligence.

Applications:
	•	Enhanced AI that evolves and adapts in real-time.
	•	Blockchain integration for tamper-proof, adaptive systems.
	•	New models for consciousness and quantum computing.
